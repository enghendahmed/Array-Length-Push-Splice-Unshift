# Array-Length-Push-Splice-Unshift
## learn how to create an Array and How to add a new items at the end of the Array using the built-in method which called .length and also .push( ), adding a new item at the beggining of the array using the built-in function which called .unshift( ) and adding a new item at the middle of the array by using the built-in function called .splice( )
### - The Array is Zero based index so the index of the first element in the array is Zero.
### - The length of the array equals the number of the elements inside the array , so length = (last index + 1) .
### - So the Last index = (Length - 1) .
# .splice(no. the index will start from , no. the elements will be removed , item1 , item2 , item 3) , where item1 , item2 , item3 are the items will be added . if you don't want to remove any elements so put a Zero .
